===============================================================================
WORK COMPLETED
===============================================================================

1. OPTIMIZING SIM7070G MODULE RECONNECTION TIME
   - Analyzing and optimizing the reconnection process of the SIM7070G module
   - Reviewing bottlenecks in the initialization and reconnection flow to reduce wait times
   - Evaluating the performance of connection steps (power on, AT commands, network registration, PDP context activation)

2. INVESTIGATING SSL CONFIGURATION ISSUES
   - Encountered some issues when configuring SSL for MQTT and HTTP connections
   - Reviewing SSL-related functions:
     * mqttSetSSL() - SSL configuration for MQTT
     * httpSetSSL() - SSL configuration for HTTP
     * socketSetSSL() - SSL configuration for socket
   - Checking SSL AT commands (AT+SMSSL, AT+SHSSL, AT+CASSLCFG) and execution order

3. INVESTIGATING AUTOMATIC APN CONFIGURATION ISSUES
   - Encountered issues in the automatic APN configuration process
   - Reviewing logic in setAPN() and PDPContextActivation() functions
   - Analyzing the process:
     * Disable/Enable RF (AT+CFUN)
     * Set APN manually (AT+CGDCONT)
     * Query APN from network (AT+CGNAPN)
     * Set APN configuration (AT+CNCFG)
     * Activate PDP context (AT+CNACT)
   - Checking handling of cases where network APN is empty or unavailable

STATUS
===============================================================================

- SIM7070G reconnection time optimization: IN PROGRESS
- SSL configuration issue investigation: IN PROGRESS
- Automatic APN configuration issue investigation: IN PROGRESS

===============================================================================
ISSUES & BLOCKERS
===============================================================================

1. SSL Configuration Issues
   - Need to identify the root cause of SSL configuration errors
   - Check SSL command execution order and timing
   - Verify SSL index compatibility with MQTT/HTTP connections

2. APN Automatic Configuration Issues
   - Issues with automatic APN retrieval from network
   - Need better handling of edge cases (empty network APN, timeout)
   - Re-evaluate fallback logic when network APN is unavailable

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

High Priority:
  1. Complete SSL configuration investigation and fixes
     - Identify root cause of SSL issues
     - Fix errors and retest with different scenarios
     - Ensure SSL works stably for both MQTT and HTTP

  2. Complete automatic APN configuration investigation and fixes
     - Improve automatic APN handling logic
     - Add error handling and retry mechanism
     - Test with different network operators

  3. Complete reconnection time optimization
     - Reduce unnecessary wait times
     - Optimize AT command execution order
     - Measure and compare connection times before and after optimization

Medium Priority:
  1. Add detailed logging for SSL and APN processes to facilitate debugging
  2. Create test cases for SSL and APN error scenarios
  3. Document SSL and APN configuration process after fixes
