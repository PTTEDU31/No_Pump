ISSUES & BLOCKERS
===============================================================================

1. SIM7070G Module Thread Stability
   - Need to ensure stable operation between different execution flows/threads
   - Potential race conditions or synchronization issues between threads
   - Working on optimizing thread communication and state management

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

High Priority:
  1. Complete SIM7070G module optimization
     - Achieve stable operation between all flows/threads
     - Resolve any remaining synchronization issues
     - Test and validate thread stability under various conditions
     - Ensure reliable state transitions and communication

  2. Testing and validation
     - Comprehensive testing of pump control logic
     - Emergency button functionality testing
     - Integration testing with SIM7070G module
     - Stress testing under various scenarios

Medium Priority:
  1. Performance monitoring and logging
     - Add detailed logging for thread interactions
     - Monitor performance metrics during optimization
     - Document any improvements made to stability

  2. Code review and documentation
     - Review completed pump control and emergency button code
     - Update documentation with new features
     - Document SIM7070G optimization changes once completed
