NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

High Priority:
  1. Enable Encryption
     - Proceed with implementing encryption functionality
     - Configure encryption keys and security parameters
     - Integrate encryption into data transmission pipeline
     - Ensure secure communication between devices and server
     - Test encryption/decryption processes

  2. Testing and Validation
     - Conduct comprehensive testing of all implemented features
     - Test device collection and control functionality
     - Validate SIM module operation under various conditions
     - Perform integration testing with encryption enabled
     - Execute stress testing and edge case scenarios
     - Verify system stability and reliability

Medium Priority:
  1. Documentation
     - Update technical documentation with completed features
     - Document encryption implementation once completed
     - Create testing reports and validation results

  2. Performance Optimization
     - Monitor system performance with encryption enabled
     - Optimize any performance bottlenecks identified during testing
     - Fine-tune system parameters based on test results
