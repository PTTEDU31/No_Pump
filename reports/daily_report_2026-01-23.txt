Project: No_PUMP IoT Water Monitoring System

===============================================================================
WORK COMPLETED
===============================================================================

1. DEVICE ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION (STARTED)
   - Started migrating the Pump Control module into a Device (Device/DeviceManager pattern)
   - Started migrating the Button/Input module into a Device for clean non-blocking handling and easier extensibility

2. AUXILIARY MODULES (LOGIC STARTED)
   - Started implementing data collection logic for auxiliary/supporting modules
   - Started implementing control/decision logic for auxiliary modules to integrate into the main loop

===============================================================================
STATUS
===============================================================================

- Device migration (Pump Control, Button/Input): IN PROGRESS
- Data collection & control logic for auxiliary modules: IN PROGRESS

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

High Priority:
  1. Finalize the PumpControl device (interface + state + events)
  2. Finalize the Button/Input device (debounce + event dispatch)
  3. Standardize non-blocking data collection & control logic for auxiliary modules

Medium Priority:
  1. Integrate into DeviceManager and verify end-to-end event flow
  2. Add minimal logging/diagnostics to trace state transitions
