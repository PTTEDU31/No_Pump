Project: No_PUMP IoT Water Monitoring System

===============================================================================
WORK COMPLETED
===============================================================================

1. COMPLETED MIGRATION OF `dev_pump_ctrl` INTO A MODULE
   - Finalized extraction/packaging of pump control logic into an independent module
   - Standardized the module interface for easier integration with the Device/DeviceManager architecture
   - Reviewed ON/OFF control flow and state handling to ensure stable operation

2. MQTT ENCRYPTION (IMPLEMENTATION & INTEGRATION)
   - Integrated payload encryption for MQTT messages based on the system reference documentation
   - Added encode/decode flow to support telemetry publishing and command handling from the server

3. MQTT TESTING (PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE + ENCRYPTED PAYLOAD)
   - Tested MQTT publish/subscribe flow after encryption integration
   - Verified the device can still process control commands and publish telemetry correctly with encryption enabled

===============================================================================
STATUS
===============================================================================

- dev_pump_ctrl module: COMPLETED
- MQTT encryption integration: COMPLETED
- MQTT encrypted flow testing: COMPLETED

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

High Priority:
  1. Run regression tests for the full pump control flow (edge cases) after the module migration
  2. Validate MQTT connection stability under weak/unstable network conditions (reconnect behavior)
  3. Add minimal logging/diagnostics at encryption/MQTT failure points to improve traceability

Medium Priority:
  1. Optimize payload size and publish interval based on power state (PWR/Battery)
  2. Evaluate main-loop performance after adding encryption (ensure non-blocking behavior)
